# Intrusion-Detection-using-the-NSL-KDD-dataset

Contains the code for Intrusion Detection using the NSL-KDD dataset:

• Developed and evaluated multiple deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to enhance Intrusion Detection Systems, leveraging NSL-KDD dataset.

• Mitigated class imbalance within the NSL-KDD dataset by applying Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) and cost-sensitive training techniques.
